Fashion recommendation system that integrates weather forecast, trending styles and your activities for the day before recommending outfits from your own closet.
Outfit Selection Simplification: Many users find it challenging to decide what to wear each day. The MVP will provide outfit recommendations based on basic inputs like mood, activities, and weather, helping users make quick and confident decisions.

Wardrobe Digitization: Users often underutilize their wardrobe because they forget what they own. The MVP will allow users to upload and organize their clothing digitally, making it easier to see and utilize all their options.

Personalized Recommendations: Instead of offering generic fashion advice, the MVP will start learning user preferences through simple feedback mechanisms. This will ensure that even in its initial stage, the app can provide recommendations tailored to the user's style.
